<h2><b>Movie Trailer Website</b></h2>

The Movie Trailer Project includes server-side code to store a list of my favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. It consist of the following files:

2) Entertainment_center.py : Contains a list of static movie instances and the calling function for creation of index.html

3) Imdb.py : Contains the user code for creating dynamic html content within the webpage index.html . COntains the python code for formating the html template by fitting in the necessary details at suitable locations.

4) Index.html : HTML page to be served to the user

5) Index.js : Javascript requirements for the html file

<h5>Running the Code Module</h5>

a) Open Terminal.

b) Nagivate to the folder containing all of the files.

c) Type the following command:

python entertainment_center.py    // Python 2.7  <br>
python3 entertainment_center.py   // Python 3.4

NOTE : This command is as per my local machine, you can modify it accordingly where you may just use 'python' keyword even for Python 3.4
