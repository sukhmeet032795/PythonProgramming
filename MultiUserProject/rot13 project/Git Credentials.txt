Instructions for Removing Cookies

If your Git client includes cookies in its request to source.developers.google.com, authorization may fail. Follow these steps to ensure correct behavior:

Identify your Git cookie file.

Run this command in your terminal:

git config http.cookiefile
The output is the path to your Git cookie file. If the command produces no output, then you have no Git cookie file and you are done.
Identify the Cloud Source Repositories cookie in the Git cookie file.

Open your Git cookie file in a text editor. Find the line that begins with source.developers.google.com. This is your Cloud Source Repositories cookie.

If no line begins with source.developers.google.com, then you are not sending a Cloud Source Repositories cookie and you are done.
Revoke the OAuth token in the Cloud Source Repositories cookie.

If your cookie contains an OAuth refresh token (a value matching the regular expression 1/[-_A-Za-z0-9]+), then revoke the token. You can revoke the token by making a request to https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/revoke and including the token as a parameter:

curl https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/revoke?token={token}
Delete the Cloud Source Repositories cookie from the Git cookie file.

Delete the line you identified in Step 2. Save the Git cookie file and close your editor.
